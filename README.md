# Statisfy

An open source app for viewing your Spotify Stats with a bunch of fancy data visualization features.

## FAQ

#### What's the ETA?

I don't know. I am a student as well so it depends on my academic life.

#### Is my data safe with you?

Yes, not that you should trust me just saying yes but it is. The data you enter in the app only contains your lifetime listening history. There's no information like credit cards in it.

#### Is this completely free?

Heck yea, everything
